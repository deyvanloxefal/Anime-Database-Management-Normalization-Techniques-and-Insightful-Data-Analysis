# Anime-Database-Management-Normalization-Techniques-and-Insightful-Data-Analysis
This project serves as a major assignment or final project in the Database course, where I have completed a series of tasks involving the understanding and implementation of fundamental database concepts. The main steps I have taken include normalizing data, creating a relational schema, utilizing Data Definition Language (DDL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML). Finally, after finalizing the database structure, I executed various queries or data analyses on the anime.csv dataset, enabling individuals to extract valuable insights or information from the data.
